# Visitor Count Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict **VisitorCount** based on factors like date, time, holidays, and weather data. It follows a step-by-step data science process from exploration to model evaluation.
## 🔍 Dataset Overview

* **Rows**: 8041 entries
* **Columns**: 21 features (numerical + categorical)
* **Target Variable**: `VisitorCount` (regression task)
* **Data Source**: Provided by course instructor

## ✅ Project Tasks

### **Task 1: Data Exploration and Visualization**
### **Task 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
### **Task 3: Model Building and Evaluation**
##  Results Summary

 **Best Model**: XGBoost
✔️ Reason: Captures non-linear patterns and interactions better, resulting in lower error and higher accuracy.

##  How to Run

1. Place the dataset in your working directory.
2. Run the notebook or script step-by-step.
3. Outputs include graphs, evaluation metrics, and predictions.
